# Log Analysis Project
A project of Udacity's Full-Stack-Web-Developer Nanodegree.

<h2>To run this program, we need to prepare a little bit:</h2>

<br>1.Download Udacity's newsdata.sql file from https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/August/57b5f748_newsdata/newsdata.zip
<br>2.clone all the files from this project and put them in a folder
<br>3.Make sure your computer have already installed Python and module psycopg2

<br>If everything goes well, you can simply input python log_analysis_api.py in your terminal to run it

<b>It takes a few minutes to run the program because there are so many datas to calculate.</b>
