# Log Analysis Project
A project of Udacity's Full-Stack-Web-Developer Nanodegree.

To run this program, we need to prepare a lil bit:
1.Download Udacity's newsdata.sql file from https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/August/57b5f748_newsdata/newsdata.zip
2.clone all the files from this project and put them in a folder
3.Make sure your computer have already installed Python and module psycopg2
4.If everything goes well, you can simply input python log_analysis_api.py in your terminal to run it

It takes a few minutes to run the program because there are so many datas to calculate.
